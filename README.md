## About ObuntuSystems

With 15 years of hands-on experience in web/mobile technology and Bitcoin, I’ve seen it all—from buying Bitcoin at $100 to consulting for startups across the globe. My entrepreneurial journey started by founding half a dozen startups, including Kitiwa, a Bitcoin exchange in Ghana.

### My Experience:
- Purchased 80 Bitcoin in 2014 for $15,000 to run Kitiwa.com.
- To secure the Bitcoin, I bought a MacBook Air for 10 Bitcoin—back when 1 Bitcoin was $100.
- As CTO, I put systems in place to ensure the security and longevity of the coins.
- Fast forward to 2024: What happened to that 80 Bitcoin? Could I have 100 Bitcoin today, worth $6 million? These hard-earned lessons are what I now share to help others avoid mistakes and benefit from low-risk, high-reward strategies.

Let’s talk about how we can make power moves together over the next decade.
